               <h2> I attended Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Ara from 2010 until 2016, a significant period that shaped much of my early childhood. The school, nestled in the vibrant community of Sungai Ara in Pulau Pinang, was where I spent my formative years from Year 1 to Year 6.

Despite the school's excellent reputation and the many friends I made, my time there was challenging. I faced bullying from some of my classmates, which made going to school a daily struggle. The teasing and exclusion took a toll on my confidence and sense of belonging. Unfortunately, the difficulties didn't stop there. A few teachers, who should have been my mentors and protectors, also contributed to my distress by treating me unfairly, which further deepened my sense of isolation</h2>

Stepping onto the campus for the first time filled me with a mix of excitement and nervousness, unsure of what the next few years would hold. However, those initial uncertainties quickly faded as I immersed myself in the vibrant academic and social life of UiTM.

During the first semester, I had the pleasure of meeting two incredible individuals who would become my closest friends throughout my time at UiTM. From shared classes to late-night study sessions and campus adventures, our bond grew stronger with each passing day. Together, we navigated the challenges of coursework, supported each other through tough times, and celebrated our achievements as a team.</h2>
